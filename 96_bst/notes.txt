DISCO:
- For the height() method, we have to account for trees that have height
  differences within the left and right subtrees.

QCC:
-

With L = level, d = depth, h = height...
1. a perfect binary tree has 2^(h + 1) - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary has 2^L nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is ceiling(log(n+1) - 1)

h=0 ; n=1
h=1 ; n=3
h=2 ; n=7
h=3 ; n=15
