DISCO:
- Everything to the right of arr[c] is less than arr[c] and everything to the left is less
QCC:
- What is this function supposed to do?
q0:
- Separate numbers? Arrange them?
q1: O(n) (one for loop)

v = arr[c]
swap arr[c], arr[b]
s = a
for i in [a..b-1]
  if arr[i] < v
    swap arr[s], arr[i]
    s+=1
swap arr[b], arr[s]
