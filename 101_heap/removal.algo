Removing from minheap:
- Traverse the tree, backtracking and proceeding as necessary. Create a
  reference to the node once it is found.
- (target == leaf): remove the element
- (target has one child) - overwrite the node with its child and the subtree
- (target has two children) - overwrite the node with the smaller of its two
                              children
